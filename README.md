# findNodesWithZeroAndOneParents


Suppose we have some input data describing a graph of relationships between parents and children over multiple generations. The data is formatted as a list of (parent, child) pairs, where each individual is assigned a unique positive integer identifier.

For example, in this diagram, 3 is a child of 1 and 2, and 5 is a child of 4:

1   2    4   15
 \ /   / | \ /
  3   5  8  9
   \ / \     \
    6   7    11


Sample input/output (pseudodata):

parentChildPairs = [
    (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 6), (5, 6), (15, 9),
    (5, 7), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (9, 11)
]


Write a function that takes this data as input and returns two collections: one containing all individuals with zero known parents, and one containing all individuals with exactly one known parent.


Output may be in any order:

findNodesWithZeroAndOneParents(parentChildPairs) => [
  [1, 2, 4, 15],       // Individuals with zero parents
  [5, 7, 8, 11]        // Individuals with exactly one parent
]

Complexity Analysis variables:

n: number of pairs in the input
